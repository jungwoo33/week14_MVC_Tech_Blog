This is the flow chart:
	server.js
		call ./controllers/index.js
			call ./controllers/home-routes.js
			call ./controllers/dashboard-routes.js
			call ./controllers/api/index.js
				call ./controllers/api/user-routes.js


Questions:
	In the home-routes.js, I printed out "posts", then it show something like this:
	Here, I don't understand why I have get "comments: [[Object]]
	And, shouldn't it be "comment" not "comments"?
